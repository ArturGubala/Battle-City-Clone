# Battle City Clone
### Description
This is a very simple version of Battle City from NES. I decided to made this game to better understand fundamental concepts of Python, improve programing skills and use in practise object oriented approach.
I tried to write this game in the vein of MVC design pattern, so class:
* **ScreenHandler** holds all sprites classes togather - represents *View*,
* **MoveController** is responsible for moving around player, enemies and bullets - represents *Controller*
### Build with
* Python 3.10
* Pygame 2.0
* Tiled
